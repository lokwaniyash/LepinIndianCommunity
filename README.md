## Shipping Info

- **Joy ships via UPS**, which has:
  - ₹900 handling charge per shipment
  - **Customs Duty:** ~77% (standard import duty for toys in India)

### Customs Office Behavior (Varies by Region)
Customs clearance and delays differ significantly based on which port processes your package. India has three main UPS customs offices:

- **Mumbai:** Generally the most forgiving in terms of undervalued packages. However, delays are common — expect slower processing.
- **Delhi:** Faster than Mumbai but stricter on declared values. Less likely to pass through if undervalued too aggressively.
- **Bangalore:** A wildcard. Sometimes your undervalued package sails through easily, other times they hold it for reassessment or extra charges.

*Tip:* If your region usually routes through a stricter office, consider shipping to a friend in a more lenient zone and asking them to forward it locally via courier.

## Tips for Reducing Customs Duty

**Important:** Indian customs on toys is very high, but there are ways to legally minimize the value assessed for duty.

### Undervaluing Tips:
- **Rule of thumb:** Declare **$1 per 100–200 pieces**.
  - Example: A 3000-piece set → $15–$30 declared value (Going slightly higher is safer).
- **How to undervalue:**
  - Add a message in **Order Notes** like:
    > "Please declare low value for customs, around $30."
  - OR directly **email** Joy or the Alibaba seller:
    > "Hi, please undervalue my order to $XX to reduce customs. Thanks!"

They are used to these requests and usually accommodate it.

### Missing Stickers or Pieces?
If anything’s missing (like a sticker sheet or a rare part), just email Joy with a photo of the step in the manual where it appears — he’ll ship it out to you free of charge (no extra shipping cost).
