## Tips for Reducing Customs Duty

**Important:** Indian customs on toys is very high, but there are ways to legally minimize the value assessed for duty.

### Undervaluing Tips:
- **Rule of thumb:** Declare **$1 per 100–200 pieces**. Go lower to be safer(Will probably have to pay more).
  - Example: A 3000-piece set → $15–$30 declared value, Going higher is safer.
- **How to undervalue:**
  - Add a message in **Order Notes** like:
    > "Please declare low value for customs, around $30."
  - OR directly **email** Joy or the Alibaba seller:
    > "Hi, please undervalue my order to $XX to reduce customs. Thanks!"

They are used to these requests and usually accommodate it. If you there's anything missing in your packaged (stickers/pieces) you can send joy and email with a picture of the step where that sticker/piece is needed and he'll send it to you for free(no shipping cost)
